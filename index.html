								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<p>Throughout my BSc and MSc in Architecture at  <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/dsse">Técnico Lisboa</a> I always demonstrated a keen interest for innovative and adaptable methodologies in my projects. This led me to a mobility program at  <a href="https://caup.tongji.edu.cn/caupen/main.htm">Tongji University</a> in Shanghai, China, where I lived, studied, and worked for a year. While travelling around China, I came across several different realities of Urban and Architectural settings, from under-developed Uyghur settlements to Asian megacities. These experiences alerted me to the current population and urbanization growth, and the challenging future of humankind.</p>
								<p>Since then I steered the final steps of my masters degree into researching innovative design and construction methodologies that aimed to reduce consumptions while maximizing performance. After concluding my masters cum laude and with multiple publications, I started pursuing my Ph.D in Sustainable Energy Systems. I am currently developing my thesis, focusing on the automation of analyses and optimization frameworks for urban and architectural practices where I focus on three pillars of urban analyses: Energy, Mobility, and Airflow.</p>

								<h4>Algorithmic Design, Simulation, and Optimization</h4>
									<p>Nowadays the large set of available simulation and design tools brings numerous benefits to the urban and architectural practices. One of these advantages is the ability to reproduce an area’s built environment at a holistic level. However, most of these tools require appropriate descriptions of simulation inputs and post-processing of the respective outputs. The description of these inputs is laborious and requires expertise, and inappropriate post-processing can mislead the planning solutions. To tackle these problems, my research explores how to automatically generate simulation models and workflows that represent urban and built environments focusing on three urban modules: Energy, Mobility, and Airflow. By integrating Algorithmic Design, simulation, and optimization in a single framework, I aim to facilitate analysis processes for urban and architectural practices. This will allow practitioners to explore their solutions with more confidence and less effort, contributing to more sustainable cities.</p>

									<p><b style="border-bottom: solid 1px #ffffff">Abstract:</b> Urbanization growth in developing countries raises concerns regarding these countries’ ability to consider slums, underdeveloped communities, and neighbourhoods in economic, health, and climatic goals. This research proposes a methodology that integrates algorithmic design and analysis strategies to define, study, and measure key parameters that affect the rehabilitation of these areas. Construction scenarios and design dimensions are analysed to establish design and comfort thresholds, and alternatives are simulated and tested to identify possible improvements. The methodology includes an optimisation step integrated in the workflow that maximizes thermal comfort, minimizes costs, and ensures fairness in the rehabilitation of large sets of buildings. This step identifies improvements in thermal comfort for different construction scenarios from which a two-staged rehabilitation plan is defined. The first stage comprises a sensitivity analysis to identify building materials regarding their improvement and cost of application, and the second defines the most suitable construction scenarios considering the results from the optimisation process for each building. Additionally, we research and document guidelines regarding the parameters tested for building design, revealing the existing conflicts between performance objectives, and the architect’s role in their prioritization.</p>

									<p><b style="border-bottom: solid 1px #ffffff">Abstract:</b> The impacts of climate change and extreme weather events can be seen all around us, causing record-breaking damage. Such events, coupled with wars and social unrest, are resulting in people losing their homes at an unprecedented growing number, forcing them to rely on semi-permanent structures. To explore the design of these structures in extremely cold conditions, a test tent made of innovative materials, capable of resisting the extreme weather in Antarctica, was made and tested on a site at King George Island, in 2019. The shelter was left on site for twelve months, during which some damage was recorded, resulting in high levels of humidity in the structure, and wind damage on the outermost fabric layer. This paper attempts to reverse-design the tent comparing theoretical and field data. Using an algorithmic design tool, the shelter was modeled within the site contours, and comfort and airflow simulations were made to assess the thermal properties of the used materials. Durability and comfort performance are discussed and compared with permanent standard structures, as are their implications on the design of similar projects in extreme weather conditions in future unpredictable climates.</p>

									<p><b style="border-bottom: solid 1px #ffffff">Abstract:</b>  As urbanization rapidly increases towards concerning levels, new methodologies and approaches are required to shape future cities. This research combines passive design approaches with building performance simulation in the same algorithmic description, to highlight the bidirectional impact of the building and the urban context in which it is inserted. To that end, the proposed workflow employs an algorithmic design tool along with validated analysis engines, to assess incident solar radiation and comfort metrics. We apply this methodology in a case study, exploring alternative building geometries to mitigate the consequences of uninformed design decisions in the environment. Results show that the application of passive design strategies can be done within early design stages, allowing a continuous workflow from project to construction while minimizing time and labour requirements regarding building efficiency.</p>

Recently, concept and volume of this new form of shared transportation vehicles captured a widespread attention and usage. This study is focused in two areas known as former French concession in Shanghai and in Xintiandi. Using one of the popular bicycle sharing app “Mobike” location and number of available bicycles is captured during a period of one week, three times a week, and every eight hours. Furthermore, this data is correlated with the existent urban framework by analysing certain aspects such as proximity to building services and daily life of locals. Allowing a quantitative and comparative evaluation with other sites regarding predictors of urban development, cyclers safety and urban quality. Then a proximity factor is introduced measuring the distance to key services, such as supermarkets, restaurants or office buildings, that impact life in the area. Finally, it will be possible to compare the quality of these areas and take conclusions regarding future studies and comparisons.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/mhome_a.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>M-Home is a timber structured house designed and prepared for the wilderness. This house is able to adapt its insulation needs and therefore, its thermal performance to all climates and forest types. Equipped with bathroom, living room and kitchen on a 75m2 ground floor. On the second and third floor it encloses a 50m2 room and studio plus two terraces that facilitate renewable energy gathering such as Solar and Wind power. Finally, the  charred wood finishing provide a more durable home as well as a less costly  maintenance.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/mhome1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>The proposal aims for an adaptable character. Thus, the windows were created parametrically in number, width and scale of glazing to perform multiple thermal and daylighting simulations according to the location of the project and shape of the windows. The charred wood siding are UV, Weather, Rot and bug resistant, and can last up to 80 years without little to no maintenance. These factors plus the water drainage system within the hollow structural wooden beams make this timer home fit to any forest and weather</p>

										<p>The program is to provide a public space intervention on the natural, and constructed territory of the city. The goal was to provide and influence the city’s development and urban qualification. To achieve this, it was elaborated a two stage plan for the structure of this proposal, which culminated in the design of a cultural promenade within the heart of the city of Mindelo, weaved together in core areas by public squares, which represent a strong push/pull force for the people. The first stage, consequently, was the elaboration of strong heuristics, concept and program that would proportionate suitable conditions to cultural, confort and economic growth of the city. There is an enormous cultural expression present in the streets of the  city of Mindelo, and there are less than capable conditions to absorb this vibrant energy. This inability reflects itself in a city full of potential and beautiful social expression without the means of exploring or improving it. Thus, this stage focused mainly on the requalification of the existing pedestrian and vehicle flows of the city,  creating a more fluid connection through several cultural landmarks of the city such as the Palacio do Povo, the town market, the municipality headquarters, the church or several other famous buildings and services included in this street block.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mindelo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p> The second stage closes the proposal and zoning plan with the requalification of the encompassed public squares. It is necessary to complete the zoning plan with the creation and design of public squares that define the promenade with the goal of bringing the existing cultural expression in the village to one of the most beautiful bays in the world and promote bidirectional synergies between the parts. With the existing flows in the city and the cultural connection with the public street being utterly clear, the design of the squares inevitably fell on the alignments of the streets, position, and on a instrospection of what is a public square. Thus the concept of alpha and beta zones emerged, which defined circulation and mingling areas, that in paralell with the terrain, materiality, and positioning, function as variables for the solution of this complex system characterized by dynamic social and cultural values.</p>

											<p><i>“Everything is Architecture” - Hans Hollein</i></p>
											<p>In this project we had to develop an interior space with the topic, “Immaterial Architecture” for the K11 Mall, in Shanghai. First we started off isolating what was spatial immateriality. We analized factors like light, shadow, gravity, smell, sound, electromagnetism, among others. For this project, as an immaterial interior artistic space sound seemed like the perfect fit. A  mechanical wave that can reverberates around a physical space, influencing its state. After this initial starting point, the chinese bell spiritual culture acted as a driver for the idea of shifting spatial awareness in a gallery within the mall through the reverberation of multiple bells' sound waves. After several experiments, a method was developed to create bell ringing patterns within the gallery through electromagnetic push-pull solenoids. These allowed us to ring the bell remotely and automatically, creating different spatial patterns.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/bells.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>For the bells' design, we wanted them to have the maximum reverberation possible to allow their sound waves to trigger the human ear, through their intensity and positioning. For this purpose, we decided to minimize the sound absorptance coefficient order to provide the shape that has the best reverberation  possible and, therefore, enhance the space-sound experiment. A single objective optimization process with a genetic algorithm helped us settle between three possible shapes with the same results.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/highrise.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>The project tries to establish urban relations between two major routes in shanghai. The bund and East nanjing road, both streets that define the corner of fuzhou road are pointing towards this major network. The aim of this project is to renew an area eroded by vehicle traffic and noise, bringing pedestrian and liveliness to its core and arteries. The main identified core strengths of the place are the fact that it is one of the tallest buildings in the area, has a strong iconic art deco style, and provides multi-layered visual relations with iconic Shanghai areas. However, the building shows a lack of pedestrian use and inneficient planning both in the northern open private space and in the adjacent crossroads. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/highrise1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>The way that this problem was dealt with lies on the connections created by open spaces and accessibilities within the requalified building. These conenctions were created by restructuring the existing building into a mixed use block. The original building identity was preserved by its symmetry, the buildings art deco style, and connections with the existing main streets, while portions of the building's extensions were opened to unveil a rich open space.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/highrise2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/highrise4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>The block incorporates three buildings, two belonging to the original hotel part of the Metropolo chain to the south, and one start up office studio building adjacent to the northern façade. Not only these open spaces generate a soft synergy between private and public domains, but also develop a natural relation between the existing program. The metropolo chain and the owner of the office building may provide contracts to companies and start ups, in which part of the the contract  is, eventually an outsource investment fraction for the hotel. The total program includes, 130 hotel rooms, 2 restaurants, 3 galleries and 10 studios.</p>
